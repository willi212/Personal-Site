            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>Hi, My name is Willi, I'm from Indonesia. Basically, I belong to Medan. 
                I have been living in Jakarta since my college life begin. After getting my CS bachelor degree, 
                I work at small IT company as Junior Full Stack Developer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my company, I have built several applications in the form of websites and services (most of the time, I was assigned to application services that got to do with messaging services and converting messages into client requested form of messages). 
                I have got to say, back then when I was still in college I had only built web application for one time, so my skill for web development is still at beginner level. 
                Currently I am doing Angela Yu's Web Development Courses in hopes of improving my web development skill.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="text-image-spider">
                <p>At my work, I had work with Java, PHP, JS, and C. The most challengging assignment is application services that is built in C languages. 
                    I was being overwhelmed by this C languages that got to do with lot of array, pointer, struct and lot of variable pointer memory manipulation. The most frustrating part is that, I am not only got to deal with lot of pointer, I also got to deal with double pointer.</p>
